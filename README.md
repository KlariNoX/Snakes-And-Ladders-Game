# Snakes-And-Ladders-Game
A CSD variation of the classic "Snakes and Ladders" board game, built using pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
It was a part of a university assignment, but I like how it turned out.


## Known Issues, Missing stuff, nice-to-haves etc
- The gui updating is ridiculously resource wasting and unoptimal. It could use some optimization
- Letting the players pick their own name would be nice
- More information should be displayed. Are the snakes asleep? For how long? The grade isn't being displayed at the snakes and ladders square. I could go on and on, but you get the idea
- The ALL-IN, should just teleport you to the end or the start, without animating the movement step by step.
- This might be a stretch, but a debug menu would be nice. Like, a cheat menu that can change things on demand. (But this can be done in the console anyways)

**Want to be breathtaking?** Help me out with any of the above!

## How to run
Simply clone the code and open the html file. No framework slop involved.

## Sources
- All the assets were provided by my Uni professor
- Pawn moving sound is from chess.com
- Background music is from Geometry Dash
- The css is pretty much stright from ChatGPT. I barely even looked at it 😅
